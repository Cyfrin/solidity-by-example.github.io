Signing messages off-chain and having a contract that requires that signature before executing
a function is a useful technique.

For example this technique is used to:

- reduce number of transaction on chain
- gas-less transaction, called `meta transaction`

### Vulnerability

Same signature can be used multiple times to execute a function. This can be harmful
if the signer's intention was to approve a transaction once.

```solidity
{{{SigReplay}}}
```

### Preventative Techniques

Sign messages with `nonce` and address of the contract.

```solidity
{{{PreventSigReplay}}}
```

```solidity
{{{ECDSA}}}
```
