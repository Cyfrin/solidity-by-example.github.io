Roulette is a game where you can win all of the Ether in the contract

A player needs to send 10 Ether and wins if the block.timestamp % 15 == 0.

1. Deploy Roulette with 10 Ether
2. Eve runs a powerful miner that can manipulate the block timestamp.
3. Eve sets the block.timestamp to a number in the future that is divisible by
   15 and finds the target block hash.
4. Eve's block is successfully included into the chain, Eve wins the
   Roulette game.
