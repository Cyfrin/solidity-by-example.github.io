/*
   Now Let's see how to guard from front running using commit reveal scheme.
*/

/*
1. Alice deploys SecuredFindThisHash with 10 Ether.
2. Bob finds the correct string that will hash to the target hash. ("Ethereum").
3. Bob then finds the keccak256(Address in lowercase + Solution + Secret). 
   Address is his wallet address in lowercase, solution is "Ethereum", Secret is like a password ("mysecret") 
   that only Bob knows which Bob uses to commit and reveal the solution.
   keccak2566("0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266Ethereummysecret") = '0xf95b1dd61edc3bd962cdea3987c6f55bcb714a02a2c3eb73bd960d6b4387fc36'
4. Bob then calls commitSolution("0xf95b1dd61edc3bd962cdea3987c6f55bcb714a02a2c3eb73bd960d6b4387fc36"), 
   where he commits the calculated solution hash with gas price set to 15 gwei.
5. Eve is watching the transaction pool for the answer to be submitted.
6. Eve sees Bob's answer and he also calls commitSolution("0xf95b1dd61edc3bd962cdea3987c6f55bcb714a02a2c3eb73bd960d6b4387fc36")
   with a higher gas price than Bob (100 gwei).
7. Eve's transaction was mined before Bob's transaction, but Eve has not got the reward yet.
   He needs to call revealSolution() with exact secret and solution, so lets say he is watching the transaction pool
   to front run Bob as he did previously
8. Then Bob calls the revealSolution("Ethereum", "mysecret") with gas price set to 15 gwei;
9. Let's consider that Eve's who's watching the transaction pool, find's Bob's reveal solution transaction and he also calls 
   revealSolution("Ethereum", "mysecret") with higher gas price than Bob (100 gwei)
10. Let's consider that this time also Eve's reveal transaction was mined before Bob's transaction, but Eve will be
   reverted with "Hash doesn't match" error. Since the revealSolution() function checks the hash using 
   keccak256(msg.sender + solution + secret). So this time eve fails to win the reward.
11.But Bob's revealSolution("Ethereum", "mysecret") passes the hash check and gets the reward of 10 ether.
