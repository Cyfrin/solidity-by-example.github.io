Contract address deployed with `create` is computed in the following way.

```
contract address = last 20 bytes of sha3(rlp_encode(sender, nonce))
```

where `sender` is the address of the deployer and `nonce` is the number of transactions sent by `sender`.

Hence it is possible to deploy different contracts at the same address if we can somehow reset the `nonce`.

Below is an example of how a DAO can be hacked.
