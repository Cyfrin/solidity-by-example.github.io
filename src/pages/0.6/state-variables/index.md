description: Reading and Writing to a State Variable

You need to send a transaction to the blockchain to write or update a state variable.

This means that you will have to pay a transaction fee.

On the other hand, you can read a data from a state variable, for free, without sending any transaction.

```solidity
{{{StateVariables}}}
```
