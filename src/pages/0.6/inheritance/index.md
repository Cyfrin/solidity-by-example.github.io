description: Example of inheritance in Solidity

Solidity supports multiple inheritance. Contracts can inherit other contract by using the `is` keyword.

Order of inheritance is important.

You have to list the parent contracts in the order from “most base-like” to “most derived”.

```solidity
{{{Inheritance}}}
```
