  html="<h3 id=\\"how-much-ether-do-you-need-to-pay-for-a-transaction\\">How much <code>ether</code> do you need to pay for a transaction?</h3>
<p>You pay <code>gas spent * gas price</code> amount of <code>ether</code>, where</p>
<ul>
<li><code>gas</code> is a unit of computation</li>
<li><code>gas spent</code> is the total amount of <code>gas</code> used in a transaction</li>
<li><code>gas price</code> is how much <code>ether</code> you are willing to pay per <code>gas</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Transactions with higher gas price have higher priority to be included in a block.</p>
<p>Unspent gas will be refunded.</p>
<h3 id=\\"gas-limit\\">Gas Limit</h3>
<p>There are 2 upper bounds to the amount of gas you can spend</p>
<ul>
<li><code>gas limit</code> (max amount of gas your willing to use for your transaction, set by you)</li>
<li><code>block gas limit</code> (max amount of gas allowed in a block, set by the network)</li>
</ul>
